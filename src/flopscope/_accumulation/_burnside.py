"""Size-aware Burnside lemma for orbit counting under heterogeneous label dimensions.

Port of website/components/symmetry-aware-einsum-contractions/engine/sizeAware/burnside.js.

M = (1 / |G|) · Σ_{g ∈ G} ∏_{c ∈ cycles(g)} n_c

where n_c is the common size of the labels in cycle c. Within any cycle of a valid
symmetry, all labels must share a size (asserted at group-construction time elsewhere;
re-asserted here for safety).
