"""Symmetry-aware cost helpers for opt_einsum contraction paths.

This module provides:
- unique_elements / compute_unique_size: count distinct elements under symmetry.
- symmetric_flop_count: FLOP estimate reduced by output symmetry.

Detection of symmetries is handled by ``_subgraph_symmetry.SubgraphSymmetryOracle``.

    Computes the direct-evaluation cost, reduced by the output and inner
    symmetry ratios when the corresponding groups are provided.

    Inner symmetry reduction is applied only when ``use_inner_symmetry``
    is True and **all** labels in ``inner_group`` are present as
    contracted indices in this specific step. If any W-group labels were
    contracted at earlier steps and are no longer present, the inner
    reduction is skipped.

    Parameters
    ----------
    use_inner_symmetry : bool, optional
        Whether to apply the inner (W-side) symmetry reduction.
        Default ``True``.
    per_operand_free_counts : tuple of int, optional
        Number of free (non-contracted) indices contributed by each
        operand.  For a pairwise contraction this is ``(s, t)``.
        Reserved for future cost models; not currently used.
